                            I am a young old soul who enjoys the outdoors, loves sports and plays games with a passion. I would say that I am honest, trustworthy and caring. A kind face in a crowd of strangers who is always willing to lend a friendly hand to anyone in need. I am motivated to achieve my goals and make my dreams a reality. My interest in technology began when I watched the Matrix, played Watchdogs on my Xbox, and browsed the internet.

                            I love football, my favourite team is Chelsea fc that I've been following since the age of 7. Played soccer, rugby and athletics when I was in school and made it to champs. Like playing first person shooters like call of duty, rpgs like assassins creed and fifa. Had my own twitch at one point and uploaded a few videos of my achievements to tiktok. Enjoy crime movies and series where you're left wondering who is the killer
